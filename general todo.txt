Wishlist: value type interpolation classes



things to do to make this project less embarassing:
-replace remaining xml with json
-stop adding binaries to source control
-heed warnings and remove or comment unused code
-provide less comments, more commentary
-start documenting the UI stuff since it's probably going to be in use for a long time
